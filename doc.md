# Základy HTML a CSS, úvod do JavaScript a PHP

HTML

Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for 
creating web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets 
(CSS) and JavaScript it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for 
the World Wide Web.

CSS

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for 
describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language.
CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of presentation 
and content, including aspects such as the layout, colors, and fonts.

This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more 
flexibility and control in the specification of presentation 
characteristics, enable multiple HTML pages to share formatting by 
specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce 
complexity and repetition in the structural content.

JavaScript

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language. It is a 
language which is also characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, 
prototype-based and multi-paradigm. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript 
is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web. 
JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is an essential part 
of web applications. 

Web browser

A web browser (commonly referred to as a browser) is a software 
application for retrieving, presenting and traversing information 
resources on the World Wide Web.

URL 

A Uniform Resource Locator (URL), colloquially termed a web address,
is a reference to a web resource that specifies its location on a
computer network and a mechanism for retrieving it.

Semantics

Semantic HTML is the use of HTML markup to reinforce the semantics, or 
meaning, of the information in webpages and web applications rather 
than merely to define its presentation or look. Semantic HTML is 
processed by traditional web browsers as well as by many other user 
agents.
